* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Node has npm)
* A code editor or IDE (examples: Atom, Brackets, Sublime)

## Installing
1. Click the green button "Clone or download" and click "Download Zip"
2. Extract the zip file to where you want it on your computer
3. Open up your command prompt and ```cd``` into the folder
4. In the command prompt, enter: ```npm install```

##Getting Started
1. Run the server with one of the two options:
   * In the command prompt, enter: ```npm start```.
   * If you don't want to use Pug, Sass, and Browserify, enter: ```npm basic```.
2. Begin coding:
   * For the basic option, edit the files in the folder "basic". You can ignore all the other folders and files for now.
   * For the advanced option, edit the files in the "src" folder.
